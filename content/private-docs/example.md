# Private Document Example

This is an example of a private document that requires a 6-digit PIN to access.

## Features

- **PIN Protection**: Each document has its own unique 6-digit PIN
- **Session Storage**: Once verified, you won't need to enter the PIN again during your session
- **Secure**: The PIN is stored in the document's frontmatter and verified server-side

## Usage

> **Note**: This is a demonstration document. In a real scenario, the PIN would never be revealed in the document content. For this example, the PIN is: **123456**

## Content

You can include any markdown content here, including:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Code blocks
- Images
- Links
- And more!

```javascript
console.log("This is a code example");
```

This document demonstrates how the private docs feature works.
